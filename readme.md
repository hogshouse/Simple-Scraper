#Hello Old Sport!

##Here we have a basic scraper, to use it I would strongly suggest using your mac.

###~ Instructions ~

1. You need Node, running on your machine: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. The install Node Package Manager by opening terminal (Tip: Use spotlight, hit cmd + space and type terminal) and run `sudo npm install npm -g`.

3. You can check the previous steps my running `node -v` and `npm -v` from the terminal window (you guessed it the `-v` flag shows what version you have installed)

4. Get into the folder in Terminal: hard to advice on this `ls` shows the files in your current directory and `cd` stands for change directory so putting the scraper folder on your desktop then going `cd desktop` to get to desktop and `ls` to see whats on there and then `cd Simple-Scraper-master`. Then run `node hog.js`.

5. Get a decent text editor (I recomend https://atom.io/)

6. Open up `hog.js` in atom and start having some fun, first replace the url with the page of an actor you feel is more of a hog than Arnold, saving the file and then running node `hog.js` again.
